This ofverview provides the material I´m using in this series of Python experiments. 


1. Negatio Propositionis (Propositional Negation)

	•	Definition: The formal denial of an affirmative proposition.
	•	Form: “S est P” becomes “S non est P”.
	•	Example: “Homo non est albus.” – “Man is not white.”
	•	This is the basic kind of logical negation used in syllogistic logic.

2. Negatio Contradictoria (Contradictory Negation)

	•	Definition: Between two opposite propositions, one must be true and the 
        other false — they cannot both be true or both be false.
	•	Example:
	•	A (Universalis affirmativa): “Omnes homines sunt mortales.” – “All men are mortal.”
	•	O (Particularis negativa): “Quidam homines non sunt mortales.” – “Some men are not mortal.”
	•	These are directly opposed in the Square of Opposition.

3. Negatio Contraria (Contrary Negation)

	•	Definition: Two propositions that cannot both be true, but can both be false.
	•	Example:
	•	A: “Omnes homines sunt iusti.” – “All men are just.”
	•	E: “Nullus homo est iustus.” – “No man is just.”
	•	In this case, both could be false if, for example, some men are just.

4. Privatio (Privation)

	•	Definition: A kind of negation that presupposes the natural capacity 
        or due disposition for what is lacking.
	•	Example:
	•	“Caecus caret visu.” – “The blind man lacks sight.”
	•	He lacks something that is natural or proper to his nature.
	•	Privatio differs from pure negation (negatio pura), 
        which does not imply such a natural potentiality.

⸻

5. Negatio per Terminum (Term Negation)

	•	Definition: The use of negative terms (not just negative propositions).
	•	Example: “Injustus”, “Inhumanus”, “Non-albus”.
	•	This is used in predication, not in the proposition as a whole.

⸻

6. Negatio Ontologica (Ontological Negation)

	•	Definition: The denial of being or existence.
	•	Aristotle, in contrast to Parmenides, affirms that non-being (non-ens)
         can be spoken of meaningfully, especially in relation to potentiality, privation, or accident.
